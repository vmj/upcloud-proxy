# UpCloud proxy

UpCloud API ambassador:
this proxy handles the authorization of the UpCloud API requests.

In other words, this proxy allows client to use plain HTTP
without HTTP Basic authentication,
and still the traffic from the proxy to the API is encrypted and authorized.
Think of `kubectl proxy`.

## Usage

Run this proxy from command line:

  $ upcloud-proxy --username foo --password bar --addr localhost:8080 &

or, alternatively, using Docker:

  $ docker run -p 8080:8080 \
    -e UPCLOUD_API_USERNAME=foo \
    -e UPCLOUD_API_PASSWORD=bar \
    vmj0/upcloud-proxy:latest

Both of those would allow you to:

  $ curl http://localhost:8080/1.2/account

and expect to get the UpCloud account info associated with 'foo' username.

Main use case, though, is to deploy this as an ambassador container in a Kubernetes Pod.
