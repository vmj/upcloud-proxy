# UpCloud proxy

Proxy that handles authentication and encryption of UpCloud API traffic.

In other words, this proxy allows clients to use plain HTTP
without HTTP Basic authentication,
and still the traffic from the proxy to the API is encrypted and authenticated.
Think of `kubectl proxy`.

Main use case is to deploy this as an ambassador container in a Kubernetes Pod.

## Usage

Run this proxy from command line:

  $ upcloud-proxy -username foo -password bar -addr localhost:8080 &

or, alternatively, using Docker:

  $ docker run -p 8080:8080 \
    -e UPCLOUD_API_USERNAME=foo \
    -e UPCLOUD_API_PASSWORD=bar \
    vmj0/upcloud-proxy:latest

Both of those would allow you to run

  $ curl http://localhost:8080/1.2/account

and expect to get the UpCloud account info associated with 'foo' username.

Without the proxy, the same request would have to be

  $ curl -H "Authorization: Basic $(echo foo:bar |base64)" \
    -H "Accept: application/json; charset=UTF-8" \
    https://api.upcloud.com/1.2/account

The proxy will add the `Authorization` and `Accept` headers.
Also, if you're sending data, it will add the `Content-Type: application/json` header.
